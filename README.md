1. GNN, sparse matrix multiplication kernel developed code, based upon FeatGraph and matrix multipliation with TVM in GNNs
2. matlab baseline, used to test TVM baseline
3. Sparse dense neural network baseline 1, also used for matrix multiplication basline in SpDNNs to find TVM IR optimizations
4. SpDNN baseline 2, made available to you previously, entered in SC '22
